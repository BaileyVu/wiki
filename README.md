## What is NEAR?

NEAR is a simple, scalable, and secure blockchain platform designed to provide the best possible  experience for developers and users, which is necessary to bridge the gap to mainstream adoption of decentralized applications. Unlike other blockchains, this network has been built from the ground up to be the easiest in the world for both developers and their end users while still providing the scalability necessary to serve those users.
