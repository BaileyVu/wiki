# Welcome to NEARVerse Portal

The NEARVerse portal is the “resource” to find information needed to start a journey into the NEAR MetaVerse. This is a place to learn about NEAR and its Ecosystem. This covers everything from tech aspects, usage, other places to learn, community and guilds.

If you are interested in building on NEAR, check out [Developer Documentation](https://docs.near.org).

## What is NEAR?

NEAR is building the infrastructure of the decentralized web, including the NEAR Protocol smart contract platform and a variety of supporting tools. NEAR is a scalable blockchain designed to provide the performance and user experience necessary to bridge the gap to mainstream adoption of decentralized applications. Unlike other next generation blockchains, this network has been built from the ground up to be the easiest in the world for both developers and their end users while still providing the scalability necessary to serve those users.

## Why NEAR?

NEAR is the only protocol and ecosystem built for mass adoption. Every single decision made is to unlock millions and billions of people to join Open Web / Web3.
