## Human Launch Plan&#x20;

Welcome to NEAR Foundation. We want to say “Hello” well and help you grow from there.

To guide your experience and make you aware of important resources and tools to do your very best work, on Day 1 you will receive a 90-day personal project plan via Trello.  Like any great partnership, we want to get to know you, and help you get to know us.  Your onboarding project plan will help you learn about your role and team, NEAR and the ecosystem, build your network, and find your community. (Sharing a template soon)
