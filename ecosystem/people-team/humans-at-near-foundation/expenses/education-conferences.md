## Education/Conferences

Education and Conferences Policy

Core Contributors may spend up to a $2000 stipend on education (e.g. online or in-person workshops) or conference attendance per year. Expenses above $500 require prior manager approval.

Conferences deemed strategic by a manager (e.g. those with high value speaking slots) will be fully subsidized. Core Contributors are strongly encouraged to seek speaking slots when attending conferences. Everyone wins there.
