# Monthly Guild Reporting

If your Guild is receiving funding from the NEAR Foundation or from funding sources that stem from the NEAR Foundation then it’s expected that you keep the Community updated with regular monthly reports.


# Submitting Your Monthly Reports

These reports are a monthly process of community governance involving review, discussion, and strategy. 

We want to hear all your highlights, metrics, and challenges that your Guild or initiative faced over the month.

You can follow this template to provide monthly reports (or feel free to mix it up!):

–

**Project Name**:

**Project Status**: _[In Progress/Completed]_

**Updated Project Timeline**:

**Highlights**:

_Brag about the attendance or engagement in terms that best fit your project/event (ex. # of submissions, # of physical/virtual attendees, # of presenters, etc.), shout out the project’s star contributors, social media mentions, or any platform or bot-specific metrics. The more links you share, the better, and keep it simple! **Bullet points are a great way to show what you are up to!**_

**Learnings**:

_Areas you would like to improve upon next time, feedback from participants, roadblocks you encountered, etc._

**Next Steps**:

_Efforts you’ll be undertaking to onboard more Guild members from this project, new related collaborations you cannot wait to share, etc._
