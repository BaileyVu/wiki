# Grants & Funding

NEAR Ecosystem has a number of ways to get your project or initiative funded.

_Note, that it doesn't have to be a startup to get funded - we have a number of ways that people solving important problems in their communities or in the world in general are getting funded even if they are not building a product or not planning to turn it into a business._
