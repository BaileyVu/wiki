Staking allows you to earn token rewards for keeping a token in your wallet.
Staking is an important aspect of blockchains with a Proof-of-Stake mechanism, like NEAR.

Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is a consensus mechanism to determine which users get to create new blocks on the NEAR blockchain.
New block creators are selected by the amount of wealth theyâ€™ve locked-up in the network.

In the NEAR network, a decentralized pool of validators keeps the network secure by processing transactions and in return these validators receive a reward.

## Staking on NEAR
Validators are people that stake their NEAR to build and maintain the NEAR network.
Potential validators should have between three and five years of system administration, performance and monitoring experience as well as familiarity with open source software.
To learn how to set up a validator node, have a look at our [Validator BootCamp](https://bootcamp.openshards.io/).


The number of seats for validators is limited, so most people who stake on NEAR are delegators.
Delegators are entities who provide security for NEAR by delegating their tokens to validators.
This empowers members of the NEAR community to provide security to the network without becoming a validator.
When you delegate your NEAR to a validator, you receive a percentage of their reward.
This is what is commonly referred to as "Staking".

## Finding Validators

The staking pool currently allows validators to choose what fee they charge on the rewards earned by their staking pools.

There are several community-run validator lists that detail who they are, how much stake they have, and other information.
These can help inform where you delegate your tokens.
It's important to do your own due dilligence before any transaction, including delegating your NEAR.
