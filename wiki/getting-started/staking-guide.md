Staking allows you to earn NEAR rewards in return for delegating your tokens with a validator. This is an essential process in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains which is required to ensure security and decentralisation.
Staking is an important aspect of blockchains with a Proof-of-Stake mechanism, like NEAR.

Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is a consensus mechanism to determine which users get to create new blocks on the NEAR blockchain.
New block creators are selected by the amount of NEAR theyâ€™ve locked-up in the network.

In the NEAR network, a decentralized pool of validators keeps the network secure by processing transactions and in return these validators receive a reward.

## Staking on NEAR

Validators are pieces of hardware, ran by individuals, groups, or organisations, which serve to secure, maintain, and run the NEAR blockchain.

Delegators are those who commit their NEAR to a validator to assist in securing the network and to earn rewards in the process.

Potential validators should have between three and five years of system administration, performance and monitoring experience as well as familiarity with open source software.
To learn how to set up a validator node, have a look at our [Validator BootCamp](https://bootcamp.openshards.io/).


The number of seats for validators is limited, so most people who stake on NEAR are delegators.
Delegators are entities who provide security for NEAR by delegating their tokens to validators.
This empowers members of the NEAR community to provide security to the network without becoming a validator.
When you delegate your NEAR to a validator, you receive a percentage of their reward.
This is what is commonly referred to as "Staking".

## Finding Validators

The staking pool currently allows validators to choose what fee they charge on the rewards earned by their staking pools.

There are several community-run validator lists that detail who they are, how much stake they have, and other information.
These can help inform where you delegate your tokens.
It's important to do your own due dilligence before any transaction, including delegating your NEAR.

## Liquid Staking

Staking on PoS networks like NEAR means that your tokens are "locked", so you won't be able to transfer or use them for any other purpose while they are staked.
This can present a dilemma for users who want to stake their NEAR, but also want to use their NEAR for other purposes.

That's where liquid staking comes in.
Liquid staking allows you to use your staked assets in other activities so that you can benefit from staking rewards, and other on-chain activities.

The number of liquid staking solutions is always growing, check out the community-run resource [AwesomeNEAR](https://awesomenear.com/) to find them.
