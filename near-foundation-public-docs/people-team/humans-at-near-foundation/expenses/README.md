### NEAR Foundation Travel Guidelines

We care about the well-being of our traveling NEARians and want to ensure you get to your destination safe and sound. Our travel guidance is noted below, if you have any questions, please reach out to your manager or People Team**.**

_Note: As we continue to deal with the impacts of Covid on our global community, currently all work-related travel is limited to absolutely essential travel. Also, most countries continue to have restrictions for entry that require proof of vaccination and covid testing. Please review travel restrictions by country or region before any essential travel to prevent challenges, delays, or quarantines._

_If you are currently staying in a country where you are not a citizen, keep in mind that a trip outside that country may require travel to your home country before returning**.**_

### **Air Fare**

Please use good judgment when booking your flight and choose the most economical and reasonable fare. Preference for particular airlines or alliances for personal reasons is not a valid reason to choose a more expensive fare. Barring unexpected circumstances or last-minute business needs, flights should be booked 14 days in advance and are not refundable. Any change fees are the individualâ€™s responsibility and should be discussed with your manager prior to making a change.

If you require special accommodations when traveling due to medical or other needs, please email your manager and People team with specifics of your travel needs.

### **Lodging**

Bookings are restricted to a standard single or double room. The budget per night is $300. Upgraded rooms are not permitted nor reimbursable. Always use your best judgment to choose the most reasonable lowest cost option when booking hotels.

### **Ground Transportation**

Only ground transportation for business purposes is considered eligible to be expensed.  This includes, but not limited to:

* Taxi or rideshare to/from the airport, to/from the hotel, and to/from event/meeting
* Mileage and long-term parking fees at your origin airport
* We recommend using public transportation or taxis/rideshares when possible.
* When a car rental is required, only a compact or standard car is permitted.

### Combining Business and Personal Travel

Combining business and personal travel is allowed as long as there is no additional cost to NF, and you get approval from your manager in advance.

### Meal Reimbursement

The individual budget is $75 per day to cover meal expenses.

### Travel Insurance (Optional):

Travel insurance may be purchased to protect your trip if you have unexpected cancellations, travel delays, medical emergencies, or lost luggage. The cost of the insurance is reimbursable, up to 8% of the trip cost.
