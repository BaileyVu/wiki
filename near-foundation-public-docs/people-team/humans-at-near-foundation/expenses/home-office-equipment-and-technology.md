# Home Office, Equipment & Technology

We don't want you to have to wait on getting the items that you need to get your job done. You most likely know better than anyone else what the items are that you need to be successful in your job.  We know you will be responsible in determining what you need to purchase or expense in order to do your jobs effectively.

If needed, you can take advantage of our $2,000 stipend to set up your home office (excluding a laptop).  Eligible items must be $500 or less. You’re welcome to purchase more expensive items; however, you must cover the difference above $500.&#x20;

For example, if you purchase a monitor for $949, we’ll reimburse $500 while you cover the remaining $449 at the time of purchase. Eligible items include:

* Chairs
* Desks/standing desks
* Headphones
* Keyboards
* Monitors
* Mouse

Ineligible items include:

* Anything that can be considered exotic, e.g. a tiny expensive monitor, gamer items, etc;
* iPad accessories (i.e. cases, Apple pencil, etc.)
* Laptop/phone accessories (i.e. cases)

If you are uncertain about how much is reasonable to spend on a more expensive item, please reach out to your Department Leader. _Any large item expense above $500 requires prior written manager approval._

### **Laptops**

NEAR has a BYO device atmosphere in general but we’ll support the purchase of necessary equipment for loan during your service. For a laptop, feel free to expense the purchase (up to $2,000) through Expensify.

Laptops paid for by us are property of NEAR Foundation. You need to report any loss or damage as soon as it occurs. Laptops must be returned (received or verified shipped) within 2 weeks upon the end of service for any reason.

### Damage, Loss, or Theft

If your equipment becomes damaged it's your responsibility to repair or replace damaged, lost or stolen items while in your possession. This is generally reimbursable but requires prior managerial approval. If it is deemed due to gross negligence, deliberate intent or if it happens multiple times, the core contributor is more likely to be asked to participate in the cost of replacement or repair.

All Macs from Jan. 2020 onward have AppleCare. Be sure to take your Mac to an Apple store if it needs a repair.
