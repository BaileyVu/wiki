# Time Off

The NEAR Foundation is a Swiss, non-profit, multicultural organization and we have core contributors across the globe. We celebrate different Holidays all over the world, and they vary by region. Because of this, we ask that you avoid scheduling meetings on the listed holidays. For other time off questions, please contact your people person on Slack (#people-team-nf) for the regulatory requirements for your location, department, and your current work arrangement.

### **Vacation**

**Take vacations, they’re important!**&#x20;

Core Contributors get 20 vacation days per year (or the statutory minimum required in your jurisdiction, whichever is more). These days are in addition to the above-mentioned holidays and closures. In order to notify your manager, please enter your vacation request via Bamboo HR in a timely fashion of intended dates to ensure proper coverage of responsibilities. A coverage plan should be established with your manager and teammates, and shared with key stakeholders (see below for notification details).

Vacation days accrue on a prorated basis during the first year.

### Sick Time

Core Contributors also get time off each year for sickness, mental wellness or caregiving sickness (e.g. sick children). These days accrue on a prorated basis during the first year. This can vary significantly by department and your working arrangements. Please contact the People team for the sick/carer’s leave policy for your location, department, and work arrangement.

### **Other Leaves**

#### Parental and Caregiver Leave Policy

Please contact the People team for the statutory leave policy for your country.

### **Notification and Tracking**

Please be considerate and notify well in advance of vacation, sick and leave days. At a minimum, sick leaves should be communicated to a manager (or at least if it is highly likely to occur) with at least 12 hour notice. Single-day vacation days should be communicated to a manager with at least a 2 day notice and multi-day leaves with at least 2 weeks notice. Multi-week leaves that can be anticipated (eg parental) should be communicated at least 2 months in advance.

Core Contributors will enter their Sick and Vacation Leave in BambooHR and may be asked to account for days taken at any time. People Ops will track other leave types on your behalf.
